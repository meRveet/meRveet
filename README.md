# Welcome my Github Page! (A work in progress)

## 👋 Hi, I’m Mervin!
Over the last two years, I have grown interest in Data Analytics and started exploring into the functions of Data Science and how it works. Eventually, I took on courses on Coursera by John Hopkins and found myself enjoying it very much! I am trained as a nutritionist and social worker by professional. During my work, I find myself looking a lot into areas that related between public health and social work. Currently, I'm looking to further enhance my skills in Data Science and at the same time picking up knowledge in Machine Learning and Deep Learning. Some of the mini projects that I have done can be found in over at these two repositories, [RProjects](https://github.com/meRveet/RProjects) and [pythonprojects](https://github.com/meRveet/pythonprojects). 

* Some of these are ongoing projects that I do to keep myself engaged and not lose the knowledge gained from the courses. At the same time, applying the skills to real world applications. They are definitely not the perfect analysis conduct but I looking forward to keep improving my analytical skills overtime. 

## Things I Do Out of Work
☕️ | Drinking coffee! Over the course of eight years, I've picked up the science of making great coffee. Currently, I brew and roast my own coffee from bean to cup. <br><br>
🚵 | Hikes and Mountain Biking. Allows me to appreciate the nature and enjoy the peace outside of the cityscape areas.  <br><br>
📖 | Picking up Tech Knowledge. I have inquisitive nature, and I enjoy reading on tech related information to see how I can utilise them to benefit my workflow. This is also how my interest in data analytics has began. I realised I am very comfortable with programming languages and to understand and utilise them for various purposes. <br>
