- 👋 Hi, I’m Mervin!
- 👀 I’m interested in public health and social work topics for work. While outside of work, I'm interested in a wide range of things. (1) Brewing and Roasting Coffee, (2) Learning R applications, (3) Mountain and Gravel Biking.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about social network connections, python language for statistical applications and refining R language on statistical applications.
- 💞️ I’m looking for opportunities where I could apply what I'm learning and also research on area like health and social connections. 
- 📫 I can be reach at mervintee@gmail.com
